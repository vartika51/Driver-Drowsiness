This research presents a driver sleepiness detection system that shows great promise for improving road safety and reducing driver fatigue-related incidents. Using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn, the system effectively handles data, visualizes trends, and applies machine learning models to distinguish between alert and drowsy drivers based on webcam data.This method uses machine learning and image processing to reliably detect face characteristics including the mouth, nose, and eyes. By using grayscale conversion, resizing, and regression tree normalization, the system processes images efficiently. Techniques like angle boost learning help reduce errors during training, focusing on key facial regions to enhance detection precision.

The system's multi-modal assessment, including Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) formula and heart rate data, provides a comprehensive evaluation of the driver's state. This approach enables real-time monitoring and timely warnings when a driver shows signs of fatigue. To further improve this system further, future work can focus on expanding the data set to include more diverse driver profiles and conditions. Optimizing the model for real-time performance can ensure smoother operation, while integrating it with existing vehicle safety systems can enhance overall safety in the future.Examining cutting-edge methods in machine learning, such as transfer learning and deep learning, may enhance robustness and accuracy. Adhering to ethical standards and privacy regulations is essential for safeguarding user data and ensuring the responsible use of this technology. By continuing to refine this system and exploring these avenues, driver drowsiness detection can contribute significantly to safer roads for everyone towards the future.
